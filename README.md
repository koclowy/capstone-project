## 📘 Project Overview

Radiology reports often suffer from inconsistency, missing key findings, and high documentation workload, which can impact clinical workflow and diagnostic clarity.

This project proposes **Echo** — an intelligent, web-based platform powered by **DrEcho**, an AI assistant designed to:

- Help radiologists generate standardized, structured reports  
- Reduce reporting errors  
- Improve workflow efficiency  
- Provide AI-assisted auto-fill suggestions  
- Ensure consistent terminology and structure across all reports

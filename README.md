## ₊⟡⋆ Project Overview

Radiology reports often suffer from inconsistency, missing key findings, and high documentation workload, which can impact clinical workflow and diagnostic clarity.

This project proposes **Echo** — an intelligent, web-based platform powered by **DrEcho**, an AI assistant designed to:

- Help radiologists generate standardized, structured reports  
- Reduce reporting errors  
- Improve workflow efficiency  
- Provide AI-assisted auto-fill suggestions  
- Ensure consistent terminology and structure across all reports  

---

## ₊⟡⋆ About DrEcho — The AI Assistant
DrEcho is an AI-assisted chatbot that allows radiologists to interact naturally:

### Example
**Radiologist:**
> “I want to perform Oncologic MRI Liver for John Doe, Male, 25 years old, birth date 7 Jun 2000.”


**DrEcho:**
- Identifies exam type (Oncologic MRI Liver)
- Extracts patient details (name, gender, DOB, age)
- Stores data in Firebase
- Suggests the correct structured template
- Auto-fills patient information into the form
- Prepares the template for completion
- This enables a smart, conversational workflow that blends AI + structured reporting.

---

## ₊⟡⋆ System Concept

The proposed platform includes:

### 1. AI Chatbot (DrEcho)
- NLP-based entity extraction
- Exam type classification
- Conversational guidance
- Pre-filling structured templates

### 2. Structured Reporting Templates

**Templates planned:**
- Cardiac CT Heart
- Oncologic CT/MRI Liver (current focus)
- OB/GYN Cervical Cancer

**Each template contains:**
- Patient info
- Predefined clinical questions
- Checkboxes, dropdowns, and text inputs
- Optional free-text fields
- Unique IDs for database mapping

### 3. AI Report Generator
- Converts filled template → formal radiology report
- Standardized format across all patients
- Export as PDF
- Saves report to radiologist profile

### 4. User & Admin System
- Login & authentication (Firebase)
- Radiologist dashboard
- Report history
- Admin controls

## ₊⟡⋆ Technology Stack (Planned)

**Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Bootstrap / Tailwind
- Responsive UI for radiologists

**Backend & AI**
- Python (spaCy / custom NLP)
- OR Node.js + Groq LLM API
- Entity extraction
- Template classification
- Report synthesis

**Database**
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Firestore (patient data, templates, reports)
- Firebase Storage for exported PDFs
